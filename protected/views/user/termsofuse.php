    <strong>12. Improper Conduct:</strong>
    Operator may take the decision to close the account, make void all activity
    on duplicate accounts and/or reclaim any illegitimate prizes where the
    following has occurred: Operator’s verification process identifies
    additional accounts opened by Participant; Operator’s service to
    Participant has previously been permanently terminated; or Participant’s
    activity and game play attempts to bypass Promotion’s system controls.
    Deliberate attempts to falsify account details may lead to the closure of
    ALL related accounts. As part of the registration verification process
    Operator may make use of third parties, which will consist of credit card
    or financial providers to confirm Participant’s identity and any necessary
    details. By entering into this process Participant agrees that Operator may
    use, record and disclose such personal information and this data may be
    recorded by any and all parties. As a condition of opening an account,
    Participant confirms Operator is entitled to verify that the age at which
    activities are legal under the law or jurisdiction that applies to them. If
    Operator is unable to verify Participant’s details or Participant is
    ultimately shown to be underage or unable and/or unwilling to provide proof
    of other information required to verify Participant’s identity, Operator,
    within a reasonable time, may close their account and/or restrict entry,
    and Participant will forfeit any payments or prizes won.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>13. Freezing and Closing an Account:</strong>
    Operator has the right to close Participant’s account at any time for any
    reason. There may be circumstances where Operator shall freeze
    Participant’s account which will prevent Participant from using the
    Website, and at the same time, supply relevant customer details to the
    applicable law enforcement authority, regulator, external party, and etc.
    These actions will be taken where Operator has reason to believe, in its
    sole discretion, that the account may be used for, including but not
    limited to, the following fraudulent activities or attempt to defraud;
    money laundering, including where this is linked to terrorist funding;
    jeopardizing the integrity of the events on which we offer game play
    markets; involvement in collusion, match rigging or cheating of any kind;
    underage; Participant is in a jurisdiction (or citizen of a jurisdiction)
    that makes the provision of Operator’s products or services to Participant
    or the use of them illegal; If Operator’s investigations are ongoing and
    unresolved issues remain, then Operator will continue to freeze
    Participant’s account, or may take the decision to close it.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>14. Breach of Terms:</strong>

    any of the Terms of this Agreement, including but not limited to, where
    Operator believes that Participant is underage; is involved in fraud, money
    laundering, collusion, match rigging or cheating of any kind; Participant
    is trying to use Operator’s products or services from a restricted
    territory; is playing in contravention of the laws in Participant’s place
    of residence. In addition, any such breach will be regarded as a material
    breach and entitle Operator to terminate this Agreement with Participant
    immediately. Operator, at its sole discretion, may disqualify any
    Participant from participation in or use of any or all portions of this
    Promotion, and refuse to award a Prize or any part of a Prize, if
    Participant engages in any conduct Operator deems to be improper, unfair or
    otherwise adverse to the operation of the Promotion or detrimental to other
    Participants of the Promotion. Such improper conduct includes, without
    limitation, falsifying personal information required during Participant
    registration or Prize claim, violating any term or condition stated herein,
    accumulating entries through methods such as automated computer scripts or
    any other programming techniques, allowing others to use Participant's
    personal information for the purpose of accumulating entries, or
    intentionally trying to defraud, reverse engineer, disassemble or otherwise
    tamper with the computer programs in connection with this Promotion.
    Participants agree that Operator may void any part of a Prize that
    Participant may have won and/or require the return of any part of a Prize
    that Participant may have won as a result of such improper conduct.
    Participant further acknowledges that any forfeiture of a Prize and/or
    return of a Prize shall in no way prevent Administrator from pursuing other
    avenues of recourse such as criminal or civil proceedings in connection
    with such conduct. WARNING: ANY ATTEMPT TO DELIBERATELY DAMAGE OR UNDERMINE
    THE LEGITIMATE OPERATION OF THIS PROMOTION MAY BE A VIOLATION OF CRIMINAL
    AND CIVIL LAWS AND SHOULD SUCH AN ATTEMPT BE MADE, EACH OF THE SWEEPSTAKES

    PERSON(S) RESPONSIBLE FOR SUCH ATTEMPT TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY

    and/or financial provider. Participant must ensure that he/she uses a
    payment method which belongs to them and is registered in their name.
